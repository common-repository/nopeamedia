===  Terms of use ===

The Print PDF Generator and Publisher plugin relies on a third party service provided by https://en.nopea.media. 
To generate the PDF document based on your configuration, the data belonging to the post, page, publication, and media post-type is sent to our api https://api.nopea.media/v2/ for processing. This is mainly because there are several system dependencies required for us to efficiently generate the PDF, which may not be available on your hosting service provider.

Nopea.media is a stateful API, which means that we only store data related to the usage statistics, and authorization data (i.e the token).
In other words, the data belonging to the post, page, publication and media post-type are not stored in the external API.
